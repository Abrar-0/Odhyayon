      <h1><a id="designcomponent">2. Description of Design Components</a></h1>
      This content provides a basic overview of the design procedures of a few key components 
				of the software. The tables will exhibit more details on key components:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Database: We will use MySQL in our database system. It will contain tables to
					describe diverse classes of information and will likewise discuss connections and 
					dependencies between each table.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server Software: Our server software will directly manipulate the contents of 
					the database 
          </li>
          <li>
            Web User: The User Software will live on a workstation and will be likewise accessible 
            on both platforms. Our goal is to give the teachers a lively platform on which they can 
            teach and give students a smooth experience on learning things.From here they can create
            classrooms, add materials and receive questions from students.
          </li>
          <li>
            Android User: All the functionalities available in web will be available here too.
          </li>

              <h1><a id="implementation">6. Implementation Plan</a></h1>
          <div>
            <ul>
            <h3>6.1 Approach</h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
            The system is developed following waterfall model life cycle. The steps are 
            requirement analysis,design, implementation and unit testing, integration and 
            system testing and lastly maintenance. The system will be developed under super 
            vision and rigorous testing to avoid bugs and meet the desired result.
          </div>
           
         <h3> 6.2 Design Pattern </h3>
          <div id="paragraph">
          
            We are using MVC (MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER) design pattern provided by Django framework. MVC helps in avoiding mixture of code from different classes designed.
            It has a common database for android app and website that can be accessed through server remotely to create, view and update.
            <br>
            <br>
            •	The model component- Handles the data and data flow of the system and performs various operations on data.
            <br>
            •	The view component- This component is responsible for how the data is represented to the user and how they interact with the data.
            <br>
            •	The controller component- Manages user interaction and passes these interaction to the view and the model.
            <br>
            <br>
    
            There are various ways in which to visualize and interact with system data. Same data can be represented differently based on different scenarios. Also when we will need to change the view of any specific part of the system, changing the view will suffice rather we would have to change the whole thing along with data. This will also make code more manageable as the various components are separated and in the same time inter-connected to ensure the date flow, connectivity between the components and full functionality of the system.
